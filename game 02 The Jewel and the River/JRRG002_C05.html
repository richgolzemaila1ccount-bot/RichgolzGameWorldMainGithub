        <p>You have noticed that you have washed your jewel completly and successfully.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>What... was that....?</p>
        <br>
        <p>You feel comfortable than before somehow.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            <pre>
        "There is so many good things in life."
        <br>
        "But sometimes, if you feel tired,"
        <br>
        "Just remind that there <b>is</b> things that you like in your life."
        <br><br>
        
        <br>
        
        "Washing the Jewel, that ritual does not mean only washing 'the jewel'."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "The most precious jewel is yourself."
        <br>
        "You were * The Jewel *."
    
        </pre>
        </i>

        <p>
            Suddenly, you realize something.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Realizing the true value of The Jewel?
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            That was the awareness that yourself was the most precious jewel in the world.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>And also, you feel your hands be more clean than before.
            <br>
            Of course that was because you have washed hands, but you feel fresh from your heart.
        </p>
        <p>But That fresh feeling was not because of the magical power.</p>
        <p>That was because of the awarness that 'there is more than one thing that you like in this life.'</p>
        <p>and also the realization that 'you are the jewel in some logic.'</p>
        <p>The most precious one.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            With a grateful heart, you raise your hands and take your jewel back with you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But, oh! The jewel became more clear and beautiful than before!
        </p>
        <p>It surely shines more than before!</p>
        <br>
        <p>With a glad heart, you raise your jewel and take your jewel near by your eye to see its shines.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It definately shines more.</p>
        <br>
        <br>




        <pre>
            "Oh, didn't I tell you?"

            "There is no such saying "being more clear and beautiful(shiny) one is just only one. " . "
        </pre>

        <br>

        <p>Yes. You and your jewel both be more clear and more shine than before.</p>
        <p>One is in material meaning, one is in spiritual meaning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You take your jewel back well, and make ready to go back.</p>

        <br>
        <p>You will go back to your days with the awareness that "there <i>is</i> things that I like in my life".</p>
        <p>That awareness made you, and will make you feel better if you feel your life is so grey.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>With two precious jewels, you go back home with light setps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>happy ending !</p>

        <pre>*Oh, there is hidden ending so please watch that also.*</pre>
